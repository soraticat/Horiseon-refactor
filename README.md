# Horiseon-refactor
The Horiseon site code was refactored as follows:

Semantic HTML elements were added to make code easier to read.

The stylesheet was edited to match the semantic elements in the index.html where appropriate.

Alt text was added to the background image as well as the other various images and icons. 

Screen reader compatibility was tested and confirmed using Narrator.

Comments were added to the stylesheet to increase readability.
